## Project Intro

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

| Folder | Purpose |
|---------|----------|
| **/app/** | Main codebase — includes scripts and logic for data processing (our simple API). |
| **/data/** | Shared and stored data sets |
| **/images/** | Diagrams, screenshots, or outputs generated by the project. Used in README or presentation slides. |
| **/notes/** | Jupyter NoteBooks with Data retrival, cleaning, and model. |
| **README.md** | Main documentation (project overview, architecture, and how to run). |


## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Below are the three key diagrams that describe the system’s design.

### 🧱 Modularity & Composability
 **Layers:** UI (React) → API (FastAPI) → Data (Local CSV Files) → Model (`scoring_model.py`)
- **Design:** Each layer is isolated — frontend handles presentation, backend handles logic, and the model runs scoring separately.
- **Reusable components:** CSV outputs and data loaders can be swapped for future APIs or database integrations.
- **Organization:**  
  `/app/` → API + model logic  
  `/data/` → clean inputs/outputs  
  `/images/` → architecture diagrams  
  `/notes/` → analysis + exploration notebooks  

---

### ⚙️ Technology Choices
- **Frontend:** React + Vite (lightweight, modular, responsive)  
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3, async, type-safe, easy to deploy)  
- **External API:** Yelp Fusion API (real restaurant data)  
- **Data Storage:** Local CSV files in `/data` (easy to update and version control)  
- **Environment:** `.env` for secrets and config variables 

---

### 🔐 Security
- API key for yelp data stored in `.env` → never exposed to frontend  
- Input validated with **Pydantic** models in FastAPI  
- **CORS** limited to approved frontend origin   
- **HTTPS** enforced when deployed  

---

### ⚡ Scalability
- **Stateless** FastAPI backend (easy horizontal scaling)  
- **Batch processing** for scoring model → fast API lookups  
- **Pagination** & **top-K results** limit payload size  
- Can be scaled to handle **larger datasets** (more hotels, more cities)  
- Future option: connect to a **cloud database** or add **Redis cache** for efficiency  
- Designed for deployment on **Render / Railway / Docker**

---

### 📡 Data / Content Flow
- The system uses **local CSV datasets** stored in the `/data/` folder instead of a live database.  
- All data is **pre-cleaned and batch processed** by `scoring_model.py`, producing:  
  - `hotel_scores_with_recos.csv` → aggregated hotel scores  
  - `hotel_recommendations.csv` → top-K restaurant recommendations per hotel  
- The **FastAPI backend** loads these pre-computed files and serves results directly to the UI.  
- The current design can easily extend to a **cloud database** or **real-time updates** in future versions

---

### 🎨 AX / CX / UI
- **User flow:**  
  1. Select preferences (radius, price, cuisines, weights)  
  2. View ranked hotels  
  3. Expand a hotel → see top-5 restaurant recommendations  
- **Design focus:** Clear cards, icons for distance/rating, simple slider inputs  
- **Error handling:** Empty-state messages & loading skeletons for better UX  

---

The backend reads from pre-computed CSVs in `/data/` and exposes simple JSON routes:
### 🧪 API Routes (File-Based)
```text
GET  /api/hotels/top?limit=5
GET  /api/hotels/{hotel_id}/restaurants?top_k=5
POST /api/score/preview   # body: { radius_m, price_levels, cuisines, weights }
GET  /health
```

---

### 🗂️ Data Management
- Source data for hotels and restaurants is stored in `/data/`.  
- Each CSV can be replaced or extended without code changes.  
- Outputs from the scoring model are saved back into `/data/` for reuse.  
- This design keeps the system **lightweight, portable, and reproducible**.
